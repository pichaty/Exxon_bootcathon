# ExxonMobil Bootcathon 2025

## Challenge Overview
This project was developed as part of the **ExxonMobil Hackathon 2025** under the theme: **Analytics & Innovation for Sustainable Operations**.

---

## Business Context

### Organization Overview
- **Parent Company**: Exxon Mobil Corporation, USA – Over 140 years in global energy, gas, and petroleum.
- **Vision**: Leader of innovation advancing modern living.
- **Purpose**: Sustainably improve quality of life.
- **Key Divisions**:
  - Upstream (e.g., deep-sea drilling, LNG)
  - Product Solutions (e.g., fuel, chemical, lubricants)
  - Low Carbon Solutions (e.g., CCS, biofuels, lithium for EVs)

## Business Case: Polymer Product Logistics

The core problem involves warehouse **inventory imbalance**, where mismatch between **inbound shipments** (based on 3-month demand planning) and **outbound logistics** (truck/marine) causes:
- Overflow costs (D&D)
- Understock scenarios
- Inefficient space utilization

**Warehouse KPIs**:
- Maximize utilization without breaching capacity
- Maintain inventory levels in optimal range (target: 70–80% capacity)
- Predict and adjust future stock fluctuations early

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset used includes:
- Warehouse_Max_Capacity
- On_Ground_Inventory_2024
- Inbound_Data
- Outbound_Data
- Forecasted_Demand & Sales
- Material_Master_Data

---

## Solution Approach

### 1. Descriptive Analytics (EDA & Monitoring)

- Cleaned and standardized all data sources
- Created inventory monitoring dashboard
- Built **Overflow Risk Alerts**
- Visualized historical trends of inventory, inbound, outbound movement

### 2. Forecast Adjustment

> We performed forecast adjustment using historical accuracy deviation, resulting in significantly improved alignment between actual vs predicted inventory movements.

- Applied statistical corrections to initial forecast

---

### 3. Optimization Engine

#### Phase 1 – Historical Simulation Model

- Developed an optimization model using past data (Jan–Sept 2024)
- Objective: Avoid overflow, minimize understock, balance warehouse utilization
- Constraints: Warehouse capacity, inbound/outbound schedule, demand window

#### Phase 2 – **Predictive Optimization with Forecasted Data**

>  **Build a New Optimization Function for `pred_data`**  
> **Constructed a second optimization function using the same logic, now operating on pred_data (forecasted inventory & outbound trends).**

- Plug-and-play design allows users to **directly use new forecast data**
- Optimizer recommends ideal monthly in/out scheduling
- Output shows stable inventory around 70–80% with reduced overflow risk

 This step ensures scalability and adaptability.
